## Why Open Science
Open science is about making the methods, data and outcomes in your analysis available to everyone. It includes:

 * Greater transparency in the experimental methodology, observation, and collection of data.
 * Better public availability and reusability of data.
 * Better public accessibility and transparency through better communication techniques.
 * Utilizing web-based tools to facilitate collaboration.


In this tutorial, you are not going to learn all aspects of open science as listed above. However, you will learn one tool that can be used to make your workflows:

 * More transparent.
 * More available and accessible to the public and your colleagues.

You will learn how to document your work - by connecting data, methods and outputs in one or more reports or documents. You will learn the R Markdown file format which can be used to generate reports that connect your data, code (methods used to process the data) and outputs. You will use the rmarkdown and knitr package to write R Markdown files in Rstudio and publish them in different formats (html, pdf, etc).



## About R Markdown
Simply put, ```.Rmd``` is a text based file format that allows you to include both descriptive text, code blocks and code output. You can run the code in R using a package called knitr (which you will learn about next). You can export the text formated .Rmd file to a nicely rendered, shareable format like pdf or html. When you knit (or use knitr), the accompanying code is executed, resulting  the outputs (e.g. plots, and other figures) appearing in the rendered document.

R Markdown (.Rmd) is an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R. It combines the core syntax of markdown (an easy to write plain text format) with embedded R code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible (they can be automatically regenerated whenever underlying R code or data changes).“ RStudio documentation.



## R Markdown
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunks in your knitr markdown using: 

```{r}
```

There are also several option that you can add to this fucntion ```{r}``` to change how your code runs (e.g. ```{r, include=FALSE}```). 

### Markdown basics
Now let's learn additional basics that you can use for creating your markdown documents. 

#### Text
Plain text

End a line with two spaces

to start a new paragraph.


#### Highlighted text and special characters
*italics* and **bold**

`verbatim code`

sub/superscript^2^~2~

~~strikethrough~~


####
escaped: \* \_ \\

endash: --, emdash: ---

equation: $A = \pi*r^{2}$

equation block:
$$E = mc^{2}$$

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Committing and Pushing Changes to GitHub in RStudio

At this point we might want to commit these changes to your version control system (Git) and push them to GitHub. Follow these steps to maintain a clear version history and ensure your work is backed up remotely.

#### Creating a GitHub Repository

1. **Create a GitHub account** (if you don't already have one) at [github.com](https://github.com).
2. Once signed in, click the **New** button on GitHub's homepage to create a repository.

   ![Create a New Repository](C:/Users/dbvanber/Dropbox (University of Michigan)/Geovis/Labs/Adv_Week_1/Adv_LabLecture1/NewGit.PNG)

   - **Repository Name**: Enter a name for your repository.
   - **Description**: Write a brief description.
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private.
   - **Initialize Repository**: Check the box to initialize it with a README.
   - **Add .gitignore**: Select R from the dropdown list.
   - Click **Create repository**.

   ![GitHub Repository](C:/Users/dbvanber/Dropbox (University of Michigan)/Geovis/Labs/Adv_Week_1/Adv_LabLecture1/GithubPage.PNG)

3. Copy the repository URL from GitHub by clicking the **Code** button and copying the URL.

### Install and Enable Git in RStudio

#### Install Git (if not already installed)
Download Git from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it on your system.

If this is your first time using Git with GitHub and R Studio, you may need to configure your credentials. Generate a personal access token by following [these instructions from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

#### Enable Git in RStudio
1. **Open RStudio**.
2. Go to **Tools > Global Options**.
3. In the **Global Options** window, click on **Git/SVN**.
4. Ensure the **Git executable** path points to your Git installation.
5. Check **Enable version control interface for RStudio projects**.
6. Click **Apply** and **OK**.

### Create or Open a Project with Git in RStudio

#### Create a New Project, and push to Github
1. In RStudio, go to **File > New Project**.
2. Select **Version Control > Git** to initialize the project as a Git repository.
3. Enter the **GitHub repository URL** you copied earlier, and choose a local folder to clone the repository.

   ![Version Control in RStudio](C:/Users/dbvanber/Dropbox (University of Michigan)/Geovis/Labs/Adv_Week_1/Adv_LabLecture1/VersionControlProject.PNG)

#### Open an Existing Project from GitHub
If you have an existing project with Git enabled, select **Version Control > Git** in RStudio and provide the repository URL from GitHub.

Once you clone the repository, you will see a **Git** tab in RStudio. This tab will help you manage your version control activities, including staging, committing, and pushing changes.

### Create your own markdown and start committing!
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
```

1. Let's also grab some data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YuX5oWjKS6vZx4zNyPwBKuiw9EJYNX5L?usp=sharing). This is spatial point dataset that I have collected as part of a project in the Open Spaces and Moutain Parks of Boulder Colorado. It consist of the points where people have taken pictures using Flickr and Panramio. We have also collected several spatial varibles that might explain why individuals might be taking photographs at these points and all other points in park. We will import the data as a sf spatial dataset.

```{r}
#getwd()

boulder <- st_read("/Users/paigelund/Desktop/EAS_548/advanced_geovisualization_week_two/BoulderSocialMedia/BoulderSocialMedia.shp")
boulder
```
This Here are the details of data: 

|  Variable  |  Description   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DB |  indicates whether the point is a   social media location (Flickr or Panramio) or a point in the park |
| extent |  extent that can be viewed at each   point estimated through viewshed analysis  |
| Climb_dist |  distance to nearest climbing wall |
| TrailH_Dis |  distance to hiking trails |
| NatMrk_Dis |  distance to natural landmark |
| Trails_dis |  distance to walking trails |
| Bike_dis |  distance to biking trails |
| PrarDg_Dis |  distance to prairie dog mounds |
| PT_Elev |  Elevation |
| Hydro_dis |  distance to lakes, rivers and   creeks |
| Street_dis |  distance to streets and parking   lots |



2. We can plot these variables using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html). We define the sf data using the ```geom_sf``` function. The different arguments control the object attributes(this can be points, lines or polygons). For example, ```fill=``` control the color of object outline. ```alpha =``` controls the opacity of the object. The final argument is a complete theme, which controls the non-data display(e.g. neatlines, gradicule title). More details can be found regarding these [themes] here(https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html). Here we use ```theme_bw```, which is the black and white theme. You can try other themes to explore the different options.

```{r}
ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data =boulder,
    fill = NA, alpha = .2) +
    theme_bw()
```  


3. At the moment, the projection is a bit weird. Let's project the data using an appropriate projection for Colorado. Use the [epsg.io](https://epsg.io/) website for choosing the an appropriate projection

```{r}
boulder = st_transform(boulder, 26753) 
ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data =boulder,
    fill = NA, alpha = .2) +
    theme_bw()
```




4. Now we will explore different methods for visualizing this data. We will add 'Gradient colour scales' in ggplot2. Here is the documentation of these options https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_gradient.html.   

```{r}
ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data =boulder, aes(color=PT_Elev),
    fill = NA, alpha = .2) +
    theme_bw()
```


5. ```ggplot2``` has several gradient colour scale options. The details can be found [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_gradient.html).  

```{r}
ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data =boulder, aes(color=PT_Elev),
    fill = NA, alpha = .2) +
  scale_colour_gradientn(colours = terrain.colors(10)) +  
  theme_bw()
```


6. Let's look at the locations above 2200 meters. For this we will need to use the ```ifelse()``` function. The function basically means if the first argument is true (PT_Elev >= 2200), the elevation is greater than 2200 meter, then print the first varible: TRUE; if not true, print the second varible: FALSE. We use the mutate fucntion to make a new variable in our boulder dataframe. We then use ggplot to plot these locations.    

```{r}
#library(dplyer)
boulder %>%
    mutate(high_elev = ifelse(PT_Elev >= 2200, TRUE, FALSE))%>% 
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(color=high_elev),
    fill = NA, alpha = .2)  +  
  theme_bw()
```


7. We can also plot different charts using ggplot. Let's compare the distance from roads and social media photographs. Here we ```filter()``` to analyze social media only. We use a box plot to compare mean distance of these photographs from the nearest road. What does this test?  

```{r}
boulder %>%
  filter(DB ==  'Pano' | DB == 'Flickr') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=DB, y=Street_dis)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
As you can see there is no [significant relationship](https://blog.bioturing.com/2018/05/22/how-to-compare-box-plots/). The mean values and standard deviation is highly similar. There are numerous other tests and charts that you can use to investigate the relationship between locations of soical media photographs and other locations in the park. 


## Additional Geovis tools
We are also going to learn about two new packages that might be helpful for your data science approach. We will learn about the ```library(viridis)```, which provides color palettes that are interpretable for visually impaired.  


### The color scale 
The package viridis contains four color scales: “Viridis”, the primary choice, and three alternatives with similar properties, “magma”, “plasma”, and “inferno”. 

![](C:\Users\dbvanber\Dropbox (University of Michigan)\Geovis\Labs\Adv_Week_1\Adv_LabLecture1\Viridis.png)

```{r}
library(sf)
library(ggspatial)
library(viridis)
## the function gives the hexadecimal colors 
## the interger give the numbers of colors
magma(10)
```


```{r}
boulder <- st_read("/Users/paigelund/Desktop/EAS_548/advanced_geovisualization_week_two/BoulderSocialMedia/BoulderSocialMedia.shp")
ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data = boulder, aes(color=PT_Elev),
    fill = NA, alpha = .2) + 
    scale_colour_gradientn(colours = magma(10))
```

We can also plot discrete values.  
```{r}
summary(boulder$DB)
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot() +
  annotation_spatial(boulder) +
  layer_spatial(boulder, aes(col = DB))
p + scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
```


### tmaps
Alternatively, we can use tmap a way to create maps using R

```{r}
library(tmap)
## Add the data - these are specific to the vector or raster
tm_shape(boulder) + 
  ## which variable, is there a class interval, palette, and other options
  tm_symbols(col='PT_Elev', 
             style='quantile', 
             palette = 'YlOrRd',
             border.lwd = NA,
             size = 0.1)

```

It is really easy to add cartographic elements in tmap

```{r}
## here we are using a simple dataset of the world 
# tmap_mode("plot")
data("World")
tm_shape(World) +
    tm_polygons("gdp_cap_est", style='quantile', legend.title = "GDP Per Capita Estimate")
```


It is really easy to make an interactive map in tmap as well 
```{r}
## the view mode creates an interactive map
tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(World) +
    tm_polygons("gdp_cap_est", style='quantile', legend.title = "GDP Per Capita Estimate")

```




## Advanced Week 1 Lab Assignment
In this week's lab, you will make an open science markdown that documents your process of data analysis and geovisualization. We will be using git to aid in version control for the code. Your assignment is to use Knitr to develop a markdown document that shows your analysis of the Boulder data (you can also use your own data if you wish). Demonstrate how you did your analysis giving step-by-step instructions with the accompanying code.       

### Questions
1. Discuss the advantages and challenges associated with an open data science approach. Provide an example based on this week's reading. (1-2 paragraphs)

2. Create a markdown document that showcases an analysis of this week's data or any other dataset of your choice. Include descriptive text that explains your analysis, and incorporate figures and geovisualizations.Include 1 chart and 1 map. Structure and explain your analysis with text, headings, highlights, images and other markdown basics. 

Bonus: Capture a screenshot of the history of your Git commits. Share your strategy for utilizing Git in your workflow.

Here are the evaluation criteria for the geovisualizations. Questions will be worth 30% of your grade, while the geovisualization and explanation will be worth 70%.

### Optional steps for Hosting a HTML of your RMD as a Website on GitHub 
It is rather simple to make your html publicly available via github. Here is an example of one I made for a recent paper <https://derekvanberkel.github.io/Planning-for-climate-migration-in-Great-Lake-Legacy-Cities/>. Below are the step to make the knit html you make for this lab into a static website. Here is another website that give more detail <https://blog.flycode.com/how-to-deploy-a-static-website-for-free-using-github-pages>  


**Create a New Repository:**

1. Click on the '+' sign at the top right corner and select "New repository."

**Fill in Repository Information:**

1. Choose a name for your repository. This will be part of your website's URL, so choose it accordingly.
2. You can choose to make the repository public (visible to everyone) or private (restricted access).
3. Optionally, add a description for your repository.
4. Make sure the "Initialize this repository with a README" option is unchecked.
5. Click the "Create repository" button.

**Add Your HTML File:**

Now, you need to add your HTML file to the repository. You can do this in several ways:
- Use the GitHub web interface to upload your HTML file. Click on the "Add file" button, then select "Upload files" and follow the instructions.
- If you're comfortable with Git, you can clone your repository to your local machine, add your `index.html` file to the local folder, and push the changes back to GitHub.

**Commit Changes:**

After adding your HTML file to the repository, you need to commit the changes. On the GitHub website:
1. Navigate to the repository.
2. Click on the "Add file" button and select "Create a new file."
3. Name the file `index.html` and add your HTML code to it.
4. Scroll down to the "Commit new file" section.
5. Enter a "Commit summary" (e.g., "Initial commit").
6. Click the "Commit new file" button.

**Configure GitHub Pages:**

Once your HTML file is in the repository, go to your repository's main page.
1. Click on the "Settings" tab (located towards the right, under your repository's name).
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
3. Navigate to the `Pages` tab and click it
4. Under the "Source" section, click the dropdown under "Branch" and select "main" (or your repository's default branch).
5. Click the "Save" button.

**Wait for Deployment:**

GitHub Pages may take a few minutes to build and deploy your site. Be patient; it usually happens within 10 minutes.

**Access Your Live Website:**

After GitHub Pages has deployed your site, you'll find the URL associated with your website in the "GitHub Pages" section of your repository's settings. It should be something like `https://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname`.
